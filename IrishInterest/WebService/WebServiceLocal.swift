As our heads spin with mythological cross-referencing, poetical leaps and the philosophical bent, it is clear that there is nothing domestic, nothing tame, about John Moriarty. The power of Moriarty is that he has found a thousand beautiful ways to say something very disturbing: we have to change our lives.\nIn this small book of big thoughts, award-winning author, mythologist and storyteller Martin Shaw situates Moriarty's work with respect to our eco-conscious era and a readership seeking spiritual and philosophical guidance. Moriarty asks of us only one thing - that we move our gaze from seeing to beholding.

Moriarty can do that. When culture is in woeful crisis, the insights never come from parliament, senate, or committee; they come from the hut at the edge of the village. Let's go there. There is tremendous, unexpected hope waiting.'<br>John Moriarty (1938-2007) was born in Kerry and taught English literature a",

This new edition reflects the many changes to our botanical knowledge since The Wildflowers of Ireland was first published in 2014. There's updated information on the distribution of native wildflowers, along with more than 90 additional species, all beautifully photographed by the author.\n\n\n\nFor ease of identification, the species are divided into colour categories and within each category the species are grouped by, for example, the number of petals in the flower or whether the species carries its flowers in a cluster or a spike.\n\n\n\nIn easily understood terminology, focus is put on the main identifying features of each plant, by colour, size, shape of flower, leaf, habitat, flowering season, and where in Ireland it might be found.\n\n\n\nThis is a must for enthusiasts of all ages and levels of experience.<br>Zoe Devlin is passionate about wildflowers and the environment. She combined her interests in botany and photography to develop the website, wildflowersofIreland.net. Zoe earnestly hopes this guide will encourage many, especially young people, to identify, understand and cherish wildflowers growing all around, if only they stop and look.<br>'",

Although they have a talented team, there are problems beneath the surface - will their temperamental star player Dereck produce the goods when it is really needed? Meanwhile, someone seems to be hatching a secret plan to have the manager replaced, just when they need him most.\n\n\n\nDeclan also carries a secret wish - that his dad will once again come and see him play. Maybe if they make the championship final his dream will come true?\n\n\n\nWritten by teacher and underage GAA coach Michael Egan, these exciting books are ideal for GAA loving children aged 7+.<br>Michael Egan has been a primary school teacher for over ten years and has coached several school GAA teams. He also set up Laois GAA TV, a website which shows highlights of important GAA club games within Laois.<br>'",
